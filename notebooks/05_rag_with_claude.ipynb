      "🤖 ANSWER:\n",
      "Based on the risk factor disclosures from SEC 10-K filings, the main cybersecurity risks that companies face can be synthesized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dependence on Sophisticated Technology**: Companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (Source 1) and Bristol Myers Squibb Co (Source 3) rely heavily on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure, making them vulnerable to disruptions in their operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cyber-Attacks and Data Breaches**: All the companies mentioned (Merck & Co., Inc., Philip Morris International Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Johnson & Johnson, and HCA Healthcare, Inc.) highlight the risk of cyber-attacks, which could lead to data breaches, disruption of operations, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory action, significant fines or penalties, financial impact, loss of revenue or assets, including intellectual property.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cybersecurity Insurance May Not Be Sufficient**: Johnson & Johnson (Source 4) notes that even with cybersecurity insurance, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business, or reputational losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Competitive Disadvantage and Reputational Damage**: Philip Morris International Inc. (Source 2) warns that a failure or disruption of their information technology networks and systems could place them at a competitive disadvantage, cause reputational damage, impact operations, result in data breaches, significant business disruption, litigation, regulatory action, including significant fines or penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Human Error, Misconfigurations, and Security Vulnerabilities**: Companies such as Philip Morris International Inc. (Source 2) highlight the risks associated with human error, misconfigurations, and security vulnerabilities, which could compromise their cybersecurity posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Governance and Compliance**: The risk of non-compliance with data governance regulations is also a concern for companies like HCA Healthcare, Inc. (Source 5), which highlights the need to comply with various laws and regulations related to patient data protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key risks that companies face include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Disruption of operations** due to cyber-attacks or data breaches.\n",
